Python-Testing
==============

Python-Testing is the market leading continuous integration system, originally created by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.  Python-Testing (and It's predecessor Hudson) are useful projects for automating common development tasks (e.g. unit-testing, production batches) - but they are somewhat Java-centric. Thankfully the designers have provided an excellent and complete REST interface. This library wraps up that interface as more conventional python objects in order to make many Python-Testing oriented tasks easier to automate.  This library can help you:  Query the test-results of a completed build Get a objects representing the latest builds of a job Search for artefacts by simple criteria Block until jobs are complete Install artefacts to custom-specified directory structures username/password auth support for Python-Testing instances with auth turned on Ability to search for builds by subversion revision Ability to add/remove/query Python-Testing slaves Ability to add/remove/modify Python-Testing views..
